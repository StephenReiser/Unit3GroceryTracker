# Steve
For the front end we used React and React Router.  The majority of it is styled with bootstrap.  There are two APIs being used onclick. Nutrixix which is getting a response when the nutrition info button is clicked, and Edamam which is getting a response when get recipes is clicked.  It would have been nice to hide the recipes to only show on the home and tabular views.  Also would have been good to sort the index route based on stuff about to expire and to highlight stuff that is already expired.

* NodeJS, Mongoose, MongoDB, ReactJS, Bootstrap.
* We setup a basic backend together as a basic sketch of the routes.  Then we made the frontend with all components in the main App.  We then broke functionalities out into components, created routes, and added styles.
* A user can log groceries along with their expirations dates.  Also, they can get recipes and nutrition informaton related to their items.
* With more time and depending on the goal, it might make sense to clean the project up and make sure it can handle certain odd cases a user might try.  Or, add more functionality.
