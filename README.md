For the front end we used React and React Router.  The majority of it is styled with bootstrap.  There are two APIs being used onclick. Nutrixix which is getting a response when the nutrition info button is clicked, and Edamam which is getting a response when get recipes is clicked.  It would have been nice to hide the recipes to only show on the home and tabular views.  Also would have been good to sort the index route based on stuff about to expire and to highlight stuff that is already expired.
